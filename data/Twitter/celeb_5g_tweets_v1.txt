1242434493945982977 2020-03-24 07:54:01 Central Daylight Time <MIAuniverse> I don't think it's related except for timing. The timing is orchestrated by them. Not Us. I don't think 5G gives you COVID19. I think it can confuse or slow the body down in healing process as body is learning to cope with new signals wavelength s frequency etc @ same time as Cov  https://twitter.com/vicster_11/status/1242433022105751553 …
1242421969905221634 2020-03-24 07:04:15 Central Daylight Time <MIAuniverse> Yes untill 5G is set up all over the world for the first time  all done at same time in every country the entire globe, Oh which happens to be when everyone is going through the first pandemic in 100 years or in their life time when world is shut down . Nice 1.  https://twitter.com/vicster_11/status/1242420550942801922 …
1242419116675420160 2020-03-24 06:52:55 Central Daylight Time <MIAuniverse> I'm using 4G tech,which I  waited 2 months to get , coz they've stopped making 4g model of this phone. I went pretty much every phone shop to look for the 4g version. So I felt forced to buy a 5G. Even the shop guy said it's harmful. I'm forced from 4 to 5g in phones now.  https://twitter.com/MIAuniverse/status/1242416079261118464 …
1242405533463785477 2020-03-24 05:58:56 Central Daylight Time <MIAuniverse> If you are in Islington/hackney please help call local authority to stop 5G work while we are in quarantined in
our homes trying to be healthy.What we need now is  Health shelter nature food our community.This can not be corporate interests time again. Its about health of humans.

1241095662885838849 2020-03-20 15:13:59 Central Daylight Time <MIAuniverse> Remember . be unified.  Be clear about what u want.  Stand your ground.  Remind each other of important roles in society. Respect and love the elderly, but frequency change in our community affects our wellbeing. Last pandemic came with radio waves . Now 5G.The shift is not easy
1239645358684344321 2020-03-16 15:10:59 Central Daylight Time <MIAuniverse> We need more tests!!! How do you Prove its not bad for us? 5G def ain't the antivirus protection i need rn. Toilet roll seems to be the thing.  https://twitter.com/Krowcity/status/1239607783865094146 …
1177196857111584770 2019-09-26 07:22:56 Central Daylight Time <MIAuniverse> Wasn't having a go at you . I was really thinking about 5G roll out this year across every country + capability
for running these as Armies and how that'll effect mining and the fact that the only country without 5G is israel but I'm sure they'll have these.I'm going back to bed  https://twitter.com/christiannutta1/status/1177192733762564098 …
1175545543357075461 2019-09-21 18:01:12 Central Daylight Time <MIAuniverse> Is MILL VALLEY is the only place on EARTH  that has banned 5G . Is it true? In 10 years all of us will mutate Into radioactive cyborgs &they will be the only people who would be still"people". Can we designate a whole country to opt out? Coz we can't all fit into MILL VALLEY  pic.twitter.com/p8LabgPTBE
1118751242233061377 2019-04-18 00:40:56 Central Daylight Time <MIAuniverse> Actually you don't own that. If you are American or European , nano particles will own you as soon as the 5G is
up and running. It builds in the nerve systems so as for the mind that can be adjusted also.  https://twitter.com/NymphiAtune/status/1118585838219223040 …

1249208410911973376 2020-04-12 00:31:08 Central Daylight Time <johncusack> For  record : on Twitter i didn’t connect 5G to coronavirus or ANY conspiracies abt spread of virus that have circulated -  I ‘m remain skeptical of 5G technology & question potential health risks including psychological health.  Again -NEVER linked to  conspiracy theories. Nyt
1249068461566935040 2020-04-11 15:15:02 Central Daylight Time <johncusack> @heykim I assume - :) it doesn’t matter there  are such serious suffering going on - But I never connected virus
to 5G - or would want anyone blaming Chinese none of that horrible stuff/ of course”
1249067341377417223 2020-04-11 15:10:35 Central Daylight Time <johncusack> SO dumb -  “while actor never mentioned virus in connection with 5G - it came on heels of those who connected 5 G to virus - thus - he’s connecting them -  “  Wow - real sound logic -    - no one needs any fear mongering - not in favor of ANY -  crazy I have to state that
1249021230805549058 2020-04-11 12:07:21 Central Daylight Time <johncusack> Nyt writers Adam sarariano & davey Alba - r in smear business?    I NEVER once connected 5G to any virus conspiracies - ever - They are too lazy or mendacious to look at my statement -  Which was clearly about long term unproven risks to health - a retraction is in order -

Why? Because it is going to make us sick & die. Where was it trialled first? Wuhan! There are 294 5G locations globally!   https://metro.co.uk/2020/03/31/ex-beachs-calum-best-blames-coronavirus-5g-technology-12482956/?ito=article.mweb.share.top.twitter … via @MetroUK
