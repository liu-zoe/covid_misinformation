						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" style="font-size:22px;">In this project, most of Google Trends data are retrieved with the time frame of January to April 2020. 2019 data is retrieved within the time frame of January 2019 to April 2020 so that we can compare 2019 data with 2020. </li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" style="font-size:22px;">Because it is a random sample of the actual complete data, the key word is “Trend”. When interpreting the data, the focus would be identifying any trends or patterns, rather than proving a relationship.</li>

						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" style="font-size:22px;">

							Twint does not require a developer account as it scrapes only the public tweets. Most importantly it returns data far beyond the past seven days. And that is the reason I went with twint.

					<h3>Conclusion</h3>
					<p>1. Two major sources of misinformation are traditional media and social media.</p>
					<p>2. Celebrities, politicians, and influencers sometimes hold the power of making a previously fringe misinformation go viral in a very short amount of time.</p>
					<p>3. Anyone can spread misinformation sometimes even by mistake. Fact check before posting on social media.</p>
